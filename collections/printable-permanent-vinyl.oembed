{"title":"Printable Permanent Vinyl","description":"\u003cp class=\"tvproduct-content-title\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" itemprop=\"name\"\u003eOrajet® 1917 vinyl is popular in the crafting industry. It is the only pressure sensitive adhesive vinyl at Express Sign Products that is compatible with home inkjet printers. Toner printing (laser printers and copiers) is not guaranteed, but is possible. Generally, toner smears more easily than water-based inks. Laminating film is required for toner prints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrajet® 1917 digital media is specifically designed to be compatible with water-based inks, such as pigment and dye inks commonly found in desktop inkjet printers. Additionally, it is compatible with oil-based and mild solvent inks.  Its matte finish and micro-porous, waterproof inkjet coating produce brilliant prints. Laminating film drastically increases durability. Lamination is required with the use of dye inks. For applications with direct water contact, edge sealing is recommended. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote After printing, the ink must be allowed to thoroughly dry, in order to avoid any issues when later combined with the laminate. Surfaces to which the material will be applied must be thoroughly cleaned and free from dust, grease or any contamination which could affect the adhesion of the material. Freshly lacquered or painted surfaces should be allowed to dry for at least three weeks and to completely cure. The compatibility of the selected lacquers and paints should be tested by the user, prior to the application of the material. Furthermore the application information published by ORAFOL must be considered.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cul class=\"a-unordered-list a-vertical a-spacing-mini\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","products":[{"product_id":"printable-adhesive-permanent-vinyl","title":"Printable Adhesive Permanent Vinyl","description":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor use with Inket printers only.\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArea of use\u003c\/strong\u003e For use in brilliant and colourful displays.
